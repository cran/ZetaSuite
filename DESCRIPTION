Description: The advent of genomic technologies has enabled the generation of two-dimensional or even multi-dimensional high-throughput data, e.g., monitoring multiple changes in gene expression in genome-wide siRNA screens across many different cell types (E Robert McDonald 3rd (2017) <doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.005> and Tsherniak A (2017) <doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.010>) or single cell transcriptomics under different experimental conditions. We found that simple computational methods based on a single statistical criterion is no longer adequate for analyzing such multi-dimensional data. We herein introduce 'ZetaSuite', a statistical package initially designed to score hits from two-dimensional RNAi screens.We also illustrate a unique utility of 'ZetaSuite' in analyzing single cell transcriptomics to differentiate rare cells from damaged ones (Vento-Tormo R (2018) <doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0698-6>). In 'ZetaSuite', we  have the following steps: QC of input datasets, normalization using Z-transformation, Zeta score calculation and hits selection based on defined Screen Strength.
